# Git Status

The command 'git status' is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, status of your repository.

Using 'git status' will show you what changes are being tracked, arent't being tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc.

Status is a command that is safe to use at any time. 
if you want to see what is going on it's good to use 'git status' in between commands until you get to know the flow better.
